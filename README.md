# ET7190-Arduino
functions for the ET7190 OBDII chipset written/translated to be used with the arduino platform

The spiFunctions are a little more mature, while I believe the uartFunctions are pretty much correct, I know that the spiFunctions are correct as I use them regularly in projects.
There are some functions that are not ET7190 specific and are not in the files (bufferToZero is one), and some variables declares are also not in these files. If anyone would like I can make a sample project that shows how to use these functions with the ET7190 chipset...
